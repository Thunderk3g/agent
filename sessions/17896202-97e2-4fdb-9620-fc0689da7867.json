Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for a specified period, usually ranging from one to 30 years. If the policyholder dies during this term, the beneficiaries receive a lump sum payment known as the sum assured. It's like buying a 'term' of protection.\n\nWould you like to know more about it or explore some options? If so, I can definitely help with that!\"\n}",
